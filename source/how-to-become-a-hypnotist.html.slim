      h1 How To Become A Hypnotist
      
      h2 Beware the pretenders, opportunists and used car hypnotists
      p Many hypnosis training courses simply scratch the surface of what is possible, and their graduates proudly display their certificates on the wall while wearing the Emperor's New Clothes.  Continuing education consists of skimming a larger area of the water's surface, instead of delving into the depths.
      p Learning tends to be limited to the classroom, so students are left with a huge gap between what they have learned and getting the experience they need to work with real clients.
      p Business and marketing training is little more than taking 30 minutes and handing out some materials to satisfy the bullet-listed item in the curriculum.
      p Some hypnosis schools specialize in a specific area of hypnosis, for example Ericksonian hypnosis or progressive relaxation.  We believe this is like having a toolbox with only a hammer in it.
      p Online you can find all kinds of hypnosis training courses that do not require contact with a single human being.  This is like expecting to learn how to swim without getting in the water.
      p Then there are the turnkey proprietary hypnosis systems.  They seduce people into believing that human change can be boiled down to a clever marketing phrase and a few scripts.
      p Many hypnotists keep their day jobs, see clients in their living rooms, and earn very limited incomes.  These hypnotists don't get the experience they need to become truly seasoned professionals. People don't see that hypnotism is a career that offers the opportunity to earn a great income while doing what you love.  To succeed as a professional hypnotist, business skills are a must.

      h3 Hypnosis Training Canada Student:  "I Feel Very Confident I Can Do This"
      p "I'm really glad I came here.  I get to watch you with clients and practice on clients with you directly observing and giving me feedback.  It's very interactive.  I feel very confident that I can do this.  The way you set it up, I have to actually do it.  When you are doing it you're going to learn much faster."
      p F.H.

      h2 Hypnosis Training in 3-D

      p Learning, divorced from reality, is also known as wasted potential.  Each student at Hypnosis Training Canada has different learning goals and outcomes.  We customize your experience to help you transform and integrate your new skills in a way that is meaningful and practical to you.

      p All of our students are expected to apply their learning to real life situations, and each student receives personal feedback on their performance.

      p We expect our students to approach their training with an open mind. Kind of like being an actor in a play. If you are learning to speak with a French accent, the fastest way to learn is by imitating someone who has a great French accent.

      p We pull back the curtain and reveal the artistry of hypnosis. Our students get hands-on, front row seats in real time hypnosis sessions. Performed by Master Hypnotists with actual clients at the <a href="www.burlingtonhypnosis.ca/contact-burlington-hypnosis.html">Burlington Hypnosis Centre</a>.  The opportunity to experience a busy hypnosis practice with everyday clients increases student learning.  It also helps those students who are building hypnosis careers to model how to run a successful hypnosis practice.

      h2 Hypnosis Training Canada is Expanding

      p We have been offering our custom hypnosis training programs to small groups of people that have been lucky enough to find us off the beaten path.  We know there is a dire need for more comprehensive and practical hypnosis training.  So, we are expanding our offerings to accommodate more students.  Here are upcoming <a href="hypnosistraining.html">training dates</a>.
