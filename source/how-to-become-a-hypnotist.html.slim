    h2 Hypnosis Training in 3-D

    p Learning, divorced from reality, is also known as wasted potential.  Each student at Hypnosis Training Canada has different learning goals and outcomes.  We customize your experience to help you transform and integrate your new skills in a way that is meaningful and practical to you.
    p All of our students are encouraged to apply their learning to real life situations, and each student receives personal feedback on their performance.
    p We expect our students to approach their training with an open mind. Kind of like being an actor in a play. If you are learning to speak with a French accent, the fastest way to learn is by imitating someone who has a great French accent.
    p We pull back the curtain and reveal the artistry of hypnosis. Our students get hands-on, front row seats in real time hypnosis sessions. Performed by Master Hypnotists with actual clients at the <a href="http://www.burlingtonhypnosis.ca/contact-burlington-hypnosis.html">Burlington Hypnosis Centre</a>.  The opportunity to experience a busy hypnosis practice with everyday clients increases student learning.  It also helps those students who are building hypnosis careers to model how to run a successful hypnosis practice.
    p Those students who wish to pursue a career as a professional hypnotist receive the feedback they need to develop the personal characteristics and attitude necessary for success:  A sense of commitment, personal responsibility, self-motivation, and the true professionalism required to put the client’s needs at the forefront and build a successful business.
    p The student who achieves excellence at all levels of our training can have the opportunity to earn an executive level income.  The student’s attitude, entrepreneurial skills, and execution of a plan of action are, of course, as important to success as mastering the hypnotic skills.
