      h1 What Is Neuro-Linguistics Anyway?
      p Our most powerful communication happens subconsciously.  Sight, sound, touch, smell, taste, emotion.
      p Language also strongly influences what we believe.  How we perceive reality is a huge factor in how we live, what we do, the quality of our relationships, what we achieve.
      p Neuro-linguistics helps you make the most of these natural human abilities.  Improve your communication.  Build better relationships.  Get what you want in life.  Help others.
      p When you work in business, law, teaching, health, or any other field that works with people, neuro-linguistics training will help you dramatically improve your communication and get better results.

      h1 Hypnotherapy & Hypnotism - What's The Difference?
      p It depends on the laws of your land.  In some places there is no difference.  Here in Ontario, hypnotherapy training and hypnotism training is the same.
      p Hypnotherapists are licensed health professionals who practice hypnosis for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.  Hypnotists help people lose weight, stop smoking, reduce stress, manage pain (with physician's referral), and improve sports and academic performance.  Anything that is considered a medical diagnosis is beyond the hypnotist's scope of practice, unless accompanied by a physician's referral.
      p Whether you want to become a hypnotist or a hypnotherapist, Hypnosis Training Canada gives you the opportunity to learn the art of hypnosis so you can help your clients get results.
